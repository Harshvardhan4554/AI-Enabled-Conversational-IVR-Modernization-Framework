THIS BACKEND FILE IS NOTHING BUT MILESTONE 2.

I have done with both Milestone 1 and 2. For Milestone 1--> I am done with documentation and all and For Milestone 2--> I am done with MY FRONTEND AND BACKEND ALSO. To run the Milestone 2 just 1st run the Frontend by clicking GO LIVE in vs code then open terminal in backend and type ---> uvicorn ivr_simulator_backend:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000.  So it will run NICELY
